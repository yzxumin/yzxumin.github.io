Abstract: A minimal Kähler manifold is a compact Kähler manifold of nef canonical line bundle, on which the Kähler-Ricci flow starting from any initial Kähler metric admits a long-time solution. It is a fundamental problem to understand their long-time behaviors and singularities. In this talk, we shall give an overview on recent developments on this topic.

Abstract: In this talk, I first introduce the classical rigidity theorem for Poincaré-Einstein manifold, which has conformal compactification in high regularity. Then I will report some recent rigidity result for Poincaré-Einstein manifold in the upper half plane model, which take the Euclidean space as its conformal infinity and whose adapted conformal metric has quadratic curvature decay at infinity. This is joint work with Sanghoon Lee (KIAS).

Abstract: In this talk, we will construct explicit examples that show the sublevel sets of the solution of a
k-Hessian equation defined on a convex ring do not have to be convex. This is a joint work with Zhizhang Wang.
