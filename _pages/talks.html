Abstract: In this talk, we focus on the relationship between the curvature and the distance on Riemannian manifolds. First we review classical results like the Bonnet-Myers theorem and the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem. Then we introduce the mixed curvature on Kähler manifolds and present our recent splitting theorem for Kähler manifolds with nonnegative mixed curvature. If time permits, I'll mention possible extensions of our work in comparison to known results for Ricci curvature.

Abstract: The prescribed Q-curvature flow equation on a even dimensional closed Riemannian manifold (M,g), was introduced by S. Brendle in 2003, where he proved the flow exists for long time and converges at infinity if the GJMS operator is weakly positive with trivial kernel and $\int_M Qd\mu<(n-1)!\Vol\left(S^n \right)$. In this talk I focus on the critical case that $\int_M Qd\mu=(n-1)!\Vol\left( S^n \right)$, I will show the convergence of the flow under some geometric hypothesis.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish three circles theorem for volume of conformal metrics whose scalar curvatures are integrable in a critical (scaling invariant) norm. As applications, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of such metrics near isolated singularities and use it to show the residual terms of the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet formula are integers. Such strong rigidity implies a vanishing theorem on the integral value of the Qg curvature, with application to the bi-Lipschitz equivalence problem for conformal metrics. This is a joint work with Zihao Wang.

Abstract: We talk about the rigidity of solutions to the minimal surface equation with constant Neumann boundary value in Euclidean half-space, and we prove that these solutions are affine functions under the assumption of one-sided linear growth at infinity.

Abstract: A minimal Kähler manifold is a compact Kähler manifold of nef canonical line bundle, on which the Kähler-Ricci flow starting from any initial Kähler metric admits a long-time solution. It is a fundamental problem to understand their long-time behaviors and singularities. In this talk, we shall give an overview on recent developments on this topic.

Abstract: In this talk, I first introduce the classical rigidity theorem for Poincaré-Einstein manifold, which has conformal compactification in high regularity. Then I will report some recent rigidity result for Poincaré-Einstein manifold in the upper half plane model, which take the Euclidean space as its conformal infinity and whose adapted conformal metric has quadratic curvature decay at infinity. This is joint work with Sanghoon Lee (KIAS).

Abstract: In this talk, we will construct explicit examples that show the sublevel sets of the solution of a
k-Hessian equation defined on a convex ring do not have to be convex. This is a joint work with Zhizhang Wang.
