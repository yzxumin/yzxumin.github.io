Title: Non-convexity of level sets of k-Hessian equations in convex ring <br>

Ling Xiao， University of Connecticut <br>

Thursday, 17 April 2025 at 9:00 am-10:00 am Beijing Time <br> <br>

Abstract: In this talk, we will construct explicit examples that show the sublevel sets of the solution of a
k-Hessian equation defined on a convex ring do not have to be convex. This is a joint work with Zhizhang Wang.
