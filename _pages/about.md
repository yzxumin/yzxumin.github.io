I am an assistant professor at Great Bay University since Fall 2024. I was a PMC Visiting Assistant Professor at [Fordham University](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/mathematics/), working with [Hans-Joachim Hein](https://www.uni-muenster.de/FB10/Service/show_perspage.shtml?id=1521). Previously, I was a Hill Assistant Professor at [Rutgers University](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/), with mentor [Zheng-Chao Han](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/component/comprofiler/userprofile/zchan?Itemid=711). I completed my Ph.D. at [University of Notre Dame](https://math.nd.edu/) under the supervision of [Qing Han](https://math.nd.edu/) and [Karsten Grove](https://math.nd.edu/people/faculty/karsten-grove/). Before my education at Notre Dame, I was a Ph.D. student of [Gang Tian](https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/gang-tian) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/).

My research interests are Analysis of Partial Differential Equations and Differential Geometry.
